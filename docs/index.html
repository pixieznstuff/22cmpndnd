                <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
                <br>
                The adventure starts in the small town of North Sun, located in the more traditional, belief-orientated lands of North Stelloro. A relatively cold climate keeps the population low in comparison to the city of Solundrum, and they are deeply entrenched in the beliefs associated with the land and its history. North Sun sits at the base of Mount Solumen, the country’s prized landmark. It occupies one of the few flat spaces that can be found in the mountain ranges, and the surrounding rocky terrain makes transportation to and from the village difficult, leaving it isolated. Despite this, the village has a healthy economy that occasionally receives support from Solundrum. While reaching the town may seem like an especially daunting task, those who are close with the country’s religion travel to the town once a year to celebrate the spirit of the land. <br>
                <br>
                <b>A BRIEF HISTORY OF STELLORO</b><br>
                <br>
                According to legends passed down through generations of the first settlers of Stelloro, the land used to be considered cursed. Beasts of the night would stalk the people, stealing not only their necessities such as food and clean water, but also their lives. It is said that some of the victims would be corrupted and turned into one of them. Responding to the increasing pressure from the monsters, the people were pushed northwards into the desolate mountain ranges, further away from the fertile lands of the south and the lush jungles of the land bridge they first crossed on arrival. During an especially harsh night of winter, the settlers found themselves struggling through a thick blanket of snow, cold, starving, and fearful of what new creatures may await them in the darkness. <br>
                <br>
                When all hope seemed to be lost, cornered against an intimidatingly massive mountain, a bright light burst aflame at its peak, turning night into day. The snow quickly melted away, despite a lack of burns to the land and people, and the air was filled with a gentle warmth. Glowing fields of grass backed by outcroppings of trees revealed themselves in the light, filling the people with glee as they realized they had stumbled upon a wonderful place to make home. Hordes of monsters that had made residence and the shadows screamed and fled, disappearing to the depths of the land, the only place they would be welcomed under the new sun. <br>
                <br>
                Sound of heavy wings flapping in the mountain breeze turned the settler’s attention back to the glowing light, where they spotted a magnificent beast plated in golden armor. Its voice boomed through the whole of the land, alerting everyone to a new age of peace. <br>
                <br>
                “No longer will this land cower under the forces of darkness. No longer will it bend to the pressures of evil. From now on, the sun will bless this land, chasing away all corruption, returning it to the pits it originated from. By my own promise, I will work to fulfill this duty by any means necessary. Long live the light!” <br>
                <br> 
                With that, the beast that would come to be known as Solumen for its blessing of holy light landed upon the summit, disappearing as the glowing light faded and was replaced by the dawn sun. With the settlers now blessed with relative peace, they quickly established the village of North Sun, named after the bright light that had appeared on the land’s greatest day. There, they would live under the protection of the sun and Solumen, praising both divine forces at the base of the mountain named after the glorious creature in the form of offerings and festivals. From this moment on, the Divine Lands of Stelloro were established, as people moved through the frontier to establish new settlements, who would later be known as Solarians.
